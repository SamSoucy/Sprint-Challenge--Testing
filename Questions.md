1. In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it()          globals, and what are good uses for them?

ans. Describe breaks your test suite into components. You can also          nest describes.  It() is where you would perform individual            tasks. This is where you can describe that individual task.

2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think        about this approach?

ans. 2.	Test driven development allows you to create test for code             before writing the code. It allows you to write testable code          that can be refactored. I think this approach can be helpful           for your code in that you will have a system in place to help          you fix bugs and make your code better.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.

ans. 3.	Three types of automated tests are End-to-end tests, unit              tests and integration tests.
